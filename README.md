**Project Title**- Data Analysis and Visualization 

**Project objective:** The objective of this problem is to explore the data, extract meaningful insights, and find different groups of vehicles in the data by using dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE.

**Data used :**  auto-mpg.csv

**Approach and methods :** Dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA and t-SNE,

**Results/ Recommendations:**

Feature Optimization: Focus on reducing vehicle weight and enhancing horsepower through engineering improvements, as these are likely to improve mpg.

Targeted Marketing: Utilize insights from popular car names to tailor marketing strategies and promotions for similar models or features that resonate with consumers.

Data Preprocessing: Apply transformations (e.g., log transformation) to skewed variables to enhance model performance and interpretability.

Segmentation Strategies: Leverage the clustering insights to develop targeted marketing strategies for different customer segments based on their preferences and behaviors identified in the analysis.

By implementing these insights and recommendations, the organization can enhance vehicle design, optimize marketing efforts, and ultimately improve customer satisfaction and sales performance.

**Actionable Insights:**

High Correlation Among Features: Features such as horsepower, weight, and displacement show strong correlations with miles per gallon (mpg). This indicates that optimizing these factors could significantly enhance fuel efficiency.

Categorical Feature Trends: Certain car names demonstrate higher sales or popularity. Analyzing the features of these models could inform future marketing and production decisions.

Skewed Distributions: Variables like mpg and weight exhibit right skewness. Data transformation techniques may be necessary for more accurate modeling.

Distinct Clusters: The t-SNE analysis indicates distinct clusters within the data, suggesting that different customer segments may have unique preferences and behaviors.
